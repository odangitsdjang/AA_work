Recursion Day
-----

Today everyone at A/a learned recursion. I came into this confidently as
I had previous knowledge of the concept. My partner ended up being John Schoeman, who
had a really brilliant and fast brain (I can't think of a better expression at the moment after 12 hours of coding).

We wrote recursion.rb first, wordchainer.rb and then finished with the bonus problems.
